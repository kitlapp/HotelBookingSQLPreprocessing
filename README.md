# HotelBookingSQLPreprocessing

## Data Preprocessing Using SQL for Hotel Bookings (Kaggle Dataset)

The goal of this project is to replicate the Python preprocessing for hotel booking data using the PostgreSQL dialect. The PostgreSQL GUI used for this purpose is DBeaver. Additionally, all locally set Python scripts from previous projects, which supported earlier KPI dashboards, have been migrated to Google Colab to improve execution speed and simplify GitHub version control. The PostgreSQL preprocessing steps are carefully compared with the corresponding Python preprocessing scripts for each step.
